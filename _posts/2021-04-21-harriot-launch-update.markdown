Thanks to Don Brower ([Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship](https://directory.library.nd.edu/directory/employees/dbrower)) and Peter Cornwell ([Hasdai Data Futures](https://www.hasdai.org/)), we've just launched the Thomas Harriot Papers Annotation Project!

Student-workers from the Hesburgh Library have begun annotating the renaissance mathematicians' thousand-page manuscripts of unpublished mathematical work, helping scholars restore some structure and coherence to this famously disorganized but historically fascinating document.

For more  on the Harriot Papers and what Notre Dame student-workers are doing, check out the [Annotations Projects libguide](https://libguides.library.nd.edu/annotations-projects) and the [Visual Glossary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gdFj5mFNxGWRzBGk3ThzO_8n_ZykTE6Js7PECBr4QgE/edit?usp=sharing) below.
