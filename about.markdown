## Arnaud Zimmern


I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Navari Family Center for Digital Scholarship](https://cds.library.nd.edu/) at the University of Notre Dame and a scholar of early modern literature, medicine, and science. I got my doctorate in English at Notre Dame, where I specialized in early modern literature, the history of medicine, and [responsible innovation](https://techethics.nd.edu/education/responsible-innovation-fellowship/why-responsible-innovation/).

My current book project, *Panaceas and Progress from Shakespeare to Milton*, combines insights from the medical humanities and responsible innovation with literary analysis. It provides a first-ever literary history of panaceas as a trope across classic genres, and shows that panaceas, before they ever became synonyms for fools' errands, were devices for exploring relationships between medical science, human sovereignty, the power of nature, and divine providence.

 I've also started a number of digital humanities projects, focusing on 17th century writers whose surenames curiously all start with H: [William Harvey](http://localhost:4000/lepetitprof/harvey_print_reception/), [James Howell](http://localhost:4000/lepetitprof/howell_therologia), and [Thomas Harriot](http://localhost:4000/lepetitprof/harriot_physic/). 
 
I hope one day to have something wise to say about or alongside my favorite book, Antoine de St. Exupery's *Le Petit Prince*, which inspired the name of this website.
