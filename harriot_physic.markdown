##Thomas Harriot (1560-1621)

 In *Thomas Harriot's Physic* I'm bringing to light the famous mathematician's medical activities and exploring why he so readily adopted and promoted tobacco from the New World to the Old.

The images below are from various of Harriot's unpublished manuscripts, and depict a sample of the sources I'm looking into:

 In February 1614/1615, Harriot sketched the upper body of a child suffering from anencephaly, a rare neural tube defect that still impacts 1 out of every 4,600 births on average in the US.

You can find the source data for these images of Harriot's *Papers* at the Max Plank Institute's [ECHO](https://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/library/0VGM2B80/&start=970&viewMode=text_image&pn=973) database.
