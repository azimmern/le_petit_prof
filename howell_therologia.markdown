James Howell, Royal Historiographer to England's Charles II, wrote countless history books, polyglot dictionaries, propaganda pamphlets, and fables. His best remembered work is the *Familiar Letters*, a semi-fictional epistolary chronicle of the seventeenth century. But his *Therologia, or The Parly of Beasts* is as fun for readers who like a good puzzle as it is rewarding for scholars who wish to know more about the period. 

In this digital scholarly edition of *Therologia*, my goal is to facilitate reading the allegory, by letting you toggle Howell's cyphered names on or off at your discretion. You can also search the text for specific persons and events, as well as for specific genres.

You'll learn about the English Civil Wars, the Restoration, Europe's Wars of Religion, animal lore, natural philosophy and theology, early modern health and diet practices, and a wide array of genres. It is full of medical recipes, including a famous endorsement for the powder of sympathy or "weapon salve." Counterintuitively, in order to cure the wound, you applied it to the weapon that had cause the wound.
