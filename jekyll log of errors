/Users/arnaudzimmern/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.0.0/gems/jekyll-4.2.0/lib/jekyll/commands/serve/servlet.rb:3:in `require': cannot load such file -- webrick (LoadError)

First Solution: "bundle add webrick" --- it totally worked!

This happens because webrick is no longer a bundled gem in Ruby 3.0. From https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/:

The following libraries are no longer bundled gems or standard libraries. Install the corresponding gems to use these features.

sdbm
webrick
net-telnet
xmlrpc
Adding gem "webrick" to my Gemfile solves the problem, but Jekyll should include it in its gemspec



----------------
2021/03/30 - "jekyll command not found" 
Mark Suhovecky got me to see that I had several versions of ssl installed through brew (1.1 and open) 
The brew install jekyll  expression wasn’t going to the ssl that jekyll needed (openssl). 
So I used vscode to open .bash_profile (which I didn’t know was a thing);
 used an export cmd (which I didn’t know was a thing) with PKG_CONFIG_PATH (which I had never seen before)
to get it to the appropriate path. 
We saved the file, closed terminal, and lo! 
Mark said he’s had to do similar things with other packages that throw command not found errors, so I reckon this is a frequent occurence.
